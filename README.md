# Fake News Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project detects whether a given news article is **Fake** or **Real** using
Machine Learning techniques. It is a **full-stack application** built using
Flask for backend and a trained ML model for prediction.

## 🚀 Features
- Text-based fake news detection
- Image upload option (placeholder for OCR extension)
- Interactive web interface
- Real-time prediction using ML model

## 🧠 Machine Learning
- Algorithm: Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Feature Extraction: TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Dataset: Fake and Real news articles (CSV)
- Accuracy achieved during training (approx. 90%+)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## ⚙ How It Works
1. User enters news text on the web page
2. Text is sent to Flask backend
3. TF-IDF vectorizer transforms input
4. ML model predicts Fake or Real
5. Result is shown instantly on UI
